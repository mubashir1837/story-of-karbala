            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The story of Karbala is one of the most significant and heart-wrenching events in Islamic history. It
                centers around Imam Hussain A.S, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad PBUH, and his brave stand against
                tyranny and injustice. This event took place in 680 AD (61 AH) in the desert plains of Karbala,
                present-day Iraq..</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>After the death of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH, the Muslim community faced a period of division and
                conflict over leadership. The Umayyad dynasty, under the rule of Yazid ibn Muawiya, sought to
                consolidate power and demanded allegiance from key figures within the Muslim community. Imam Hussain
                A.S, known for his piety, justice, and strong moral character, refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid, as
                he believed Yazid's rule was unjust and contrary to the principles of Islam.</p>

        <section id="journey-to-karbala">
            <h2>Journey to Karbala</h2>
            <p>Imam Hussain A.S, along with his family and a small group of loyal companions, left his hometown of
                Medina for Mecca in April 680 AD to avoid forced allegiance to Yazid. During the Hajj season, Imam
                Hussain A.S received numerous letters from the people of Kufa (a city in present-day Iraq) expressing
                their desire for his leadership and pledging their support against Yazid’s rule. In response to these
                calls for help, Imam Hussain A.S decided to travel to Kufa.
            </p>
            <p>
                On his way to Kufa, Imam Hussain A.S and his caravan were intercepted by Yazid’s forces. They were
                diverted to the plains of Karbala, where they were surrounded and cut off from access to water from the
                Euphrates River. Despite the growing danger, Imam Hussain A.S refused to submit to Yazid’s authority and
                continued to uphold his principles of justice and truth.</p>

        <section id="The Siege">
            <h2>The Siege</h2>
            <p>The siege of Karbala lasted for several days. Imam Hussain A.S and his followers endured severe thirst
                and hunger as the scorching desert heat took its toll. Yazid's army, numbering in the thousands, vastly
                outnumbered Imam Hussain A.S’s small group of around 72 men, including his family members and
                supporters. Despite the overwhelming odds, Imam Hussain A.S remained resolute and continued to inspire
                his followers with his unwavering faith and determination.</p>

        <section id="The Battle of Karbala">
            <h2>The Battle of Karbala</h2>
            <p>The battle commenced on the 10th of Muharram, known as Ashura, in the year 680 AD. Imam Hussain A.S,
                knowing the inevitability of their fate, gave a heartfelt speech to his followers, emphasizing the
                importance of standing for justice and truth even in the face of death. His companions, driven by their
                loyalty and love for Imam Hussain A.S, prepared themselves for the ultimate sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>
                One by one, Imam Hussain A.S’s companions went to the battlefield, displaying unparalleled bravery and
                valor. Despite their heroic efforts, they were eventually overpowered and martyred by Yazid’s forces.
                Imam Hussain A.S, after witnessing the martyrdom of his beloved companions and family members, including
                his young son Ali Asghar, went to the battlefield himself. He fought courageously but was eventually
                surrounded and brutally martyred.</p>
